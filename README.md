## My process

Built the semantic markup following the design layers and nesting followed by styling the elements in order from top to bottom forseeing details in each section.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

learnt how to positiojn the card using flexbox, learnt how to use variable fonts and custom css properties for setting up general styling like color.

### Continued development

I would like to focus more on understanding initial css rule setup * properties and in depth understanding of flexbox and grid.



### Useful resources
